# Quick Programing Extensions

Utility of extensions assembled inorder to boost development efficiency.
Indeed a quick programming utility for flutter developers.

## Getting Started

`pubspec.yaml`

### Add super text to pubspec.yaml file

```yaml

...
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  qp_xt:
    git: https://github.com/rey-xi/qp_xt.git
...

```

### Or

```yaml

...
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  qp_xt: ^0.0.1
...

```

### Usage

This package did not in anyway declare any new classes just extensions to
existing ones; providing extra interfaces for more swift and easy programing
experience.

This package has extensions across the following existing classes with detailed
documentation.

- num (Number, Numbers)
- Color (Swatch, Swatches)
- String (Grammar)
- Symbol (ID, IDs)
- Iterable (Collection)
- DateTime (Calender)
- Color (Color)
